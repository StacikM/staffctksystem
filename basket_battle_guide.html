FOR MODERATOR USE ONLY!!!

Section 1: ‚ö†Ô∏è Spam, Pings and Advertising ‚ö†Ô∏è
No spam of any kind is allowed on the server. There are a few different types of spam that require different actions.
If a user is spamming with a single word or sentence, the third time they do it is a warning, the fifth time is a mute, and the seventh time is a ban. This is appealable.
A chat must be an hour old  for any future potentially annoying chat to count towards their spam. However, if they do start another wave of spam, this is punishable with a mute the second occasion, then a ban after the third. This is also appealable.
If a user spams with a large message, the bot will automatically mute the user. On the second mute or occasion, a ban should be given. This is appealable.
If a user advertises a server/game via spamming links an automatic ban should be given. This is not appealable.
Pinging other users is not possible unless it's via replies, but action should be taken nonetheless.
If the user tries the @everyone command, make fun of them.
If the user pings a mod via replies, no action needs to be taken unless they keep using it. In which case, a warning without the use of commands should be given after one offense, a formal warning after two pings, a mute after three, and a ban after repeated offenses. This is appealable.
Additionally, no action should be taken when a mod says ‚Äú@everyone hru?‚Äù.
If a user deliberately pings using @, a formal warning should be immediately given
 If a user uses @ to ping a head mod, admin or owner, they are to be immediately banned. This is appealable.
If a mod tries to directly ping a mod using @, this is punishable with a mute. If they repeat this offense again, this is bannable. This is appealable.
Advertising of any kind, whether through server chat or DMs is immediately bannable, and is not appealable.
However, if the user is DMing a friend or any user that they have formed a strong connection with, this is allowed. They cannot be annoying about it or DM multiple people about it, however.
DMing a moderator or user for no reason or attempting to call repeatedly results in an unappealable ban.
If the user keeps asking for this in server chat, a warning without the use of commands should be given on the first offense, a formal warning on the second, a mute on the third, and a ban for continuous offense. This is not appealable.
However, as long as the user is not being annoying and does not call, a friendly DM is allowed.
In case the user calls, they shall receive a verbal warning the first occasion, a mute (if not by accident) on the second occasion, and an unappealable ban on the third occasion.
Spamming tickets or opening one for no reason results in an unappealable ban.

Section 2: ü§¨ Chats and Swears ü§¨
A user may not speak to another in a way that belittles or attacks anothe, or bicker with them. This is the trickiest part of moderation, since are many forms of arguments and bullying
If two users are arguing, a verbal warning is required to the two users once the argument starts to become heated, and the moderator must attempt to resolve the conflict. If the argument continues or gets out of hand, a suspension of 1-120 days (depending on the severity) should be issued. This may or may not be appealable.
A warning can also be given if the moderator sees fit.
If a user is arguing with a mod, a warning should be given the moment the user decides to be rude, and a suspension if they try to keep arguing.
Arguing in DMs results in an unappealable ban. The only exception is moderators slandering little kids who are whining for whatever reason.
Using profanity grants a punishment, classified into three tiers.
Tier 1: If a word like ‚Äústupid‚Äù or ‚Äúidiot‚Äù, or a non-severe insult is used, this grants a warning.
Tier 2: If a word like ‚Äúbitch‚Äù or ‚Äúfuck‚Äù, or a severe insult is used is used, this grants a mute.
Tier 3: The usage of heavy profanity or slurs results in an unappealable ban.
Roasts, unless it is from a moderator or it‚Äôs called for, results in an unappealable ban 
Swears are prohibited unless they are ‚ÄúTier 1‚Äù swears.
If a user tries to use a ‚ÄúTier 2‚Äù swear word two times, a warning should be given. After four offenses, a mute should be given, and if the offense continues, this results in a ban. This is appealable.
‚ÄúTier 3‚Äù swear words are immediately bannable, even after one usage. This is unappealable.
If a user tries to/does bypass the bot by swearing in a different language, they should be muted on the first offense, then receive an unappealable ban if they try it again.
Please be aware that the user might speak a different language, so if a moderator feel like this is the case, they may use the same rules as regular swearing
The asking or mentioning of sexual things, even as a minor joke, is not allowed. The first (if it's not serious) results in a mute, and if they continue this behavior or it's a serious issue, an unappealable ban should be given.
All serious political or religious topics are strictly prohibited. If a user mentions one of these one time, a warning should be given, followed by a mute after the second time, and a ban after repeated offenses.
Absolutely no mention of any form of privacy, 18+ content or any suspicious content. This will result in an unappealable ban.
A user may not share any personal info.
If they reveal info about themselves, the first offense is a warning, the second is a mute, and repeated offenses grants an unappealable ban.
If the user asks for any personal info:
A non-severe case results in a mute.
A severe or repeated case results in an unappealable ban.
If a user shares info about another individual, they are to be immediately banned.
All religious topics (except for saying ‚ÄúOh my god‚Äù are prohibited. The first instance of bringing it up is a warning, the second is a mute, and any further occasions results in a ban. This is appealable.
Asking to be muted or banned results in an unappealable ban.
In the case of a raid or mass spam, the servers must be locked immediately if the bot does not do it already. All participants must then be banned without appeal.
Section 3: üë• Profiles üë•
Any inappropriate username (that bypasses the bot), profile picture or bio results in an immediate strike.
From there, unless there is any truly disgusting content, the user will have 1 hour to get it changed, otherwise they will face an unappealable ban.
No user under 13+ may enter the server, with an unappealable ban and report being issued if this rule is not followed. If an underage user is suspected, ask if they meet the age requirements.
Be aware that they might try to deny this, so a moderator might need to use super cool interrogation skills.
However, if their excuse is, to say the least, pure BS, they can be banned.

Section 4: ‚öñÔ∏è The Duties of the Moderator ‚öñÔ∏è
The usage of @everyone can only be used at least three-and-a-half hours after a previous usage, and only between 8am-8pm EST.
It is alright if you make an occasional mistake and wrongfully punish someone, just as long as you apologize and revoke the punishment 
However, if you continue to make mistakes, it is a sign that you do not know how to effectively moderate, and your role will be revoked.
Any punishment to any rule may be heightened just as long as it is appropriate to do so 
Even though you are a higher power, you must be respectful. Unless a 5 year old is being annoying. Then you can engage in some slander.
You should not argue with others, nor should you be the reason why an argument starts.
ABSOLUTELY NO ABUSING POWERS. If you do this, you will be banned by the bot.
Junior mods may need to use the strike command to ban users in an emergency. Because of the bot, however, do not do this frequently.
Any moderator of higher power may demote you for any reason.
If you wish to resign at any point, please let Stacik know.
If you are inactive, you could get warned and demoted.
If you cannot be active for whatever reason, please let Stacik know
